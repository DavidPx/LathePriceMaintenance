# LathePriceMaintenance
A series of programs to upload wood lathe prices to my [lathe spreadsheet](https://tracezero.net/woodworking/lathe-comparison-list/).

Scraper produces a series of `.csv` files, once for each pricing source.  A second program then collects that data and uploads it to the spreadsheet.

This process started as an [OctoParse](https://www.octoparse.com/) flow but it's too UI-heavy for me making it slow to run and difficult to make wholesale changes in the flow.  
A program is not only fun to write but also lets me easily customize any piece of the data collection process.
