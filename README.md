# LathePriceMaintenance
A series of programs to upload wood lathe prices to my [lathe spreadsheet](https://tracezero.net/woodworking/lathe-comparison-list/).

Scraper produces a series of `.csv` files, once for each pricing source.  A second program then collects that data and uploads it to the spreadsheet.
